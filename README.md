# 8-bit-Microcontroller_Verilog

RISC  (Reduced  Instruction  Set  Computer)  is  a  design  concept  aimed  at reducing  the  complexity  of  the  instruction  set,  which  in  turn  reduces  the amount  of  space,  cycle  time,  cost  and  other  parameters  considered  during the design implementation.  The advent of FPGA has allowed the implementation of the complex logical systems on FPGA. The aim of this project isto design the micro controller based on 8 bit RISC architecture using Verilog and  implement  it  on  FPGA  Spartan  3E  device.It  takes  into  consideration very  simple  instruction  set.   The  blocks  in  this  micro  controller  are  ALU,accumulator,  Adders,  MUX, registers and memories.  It is non-pipelined and follows a Harvard architecture type memory (i.e.  separate memories for program and data instructions).
